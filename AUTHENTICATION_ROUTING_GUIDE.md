# Authentication & Role-Based Routing Guide

## Overview
The application now properly handles authentication persistence on page refresh and routes users to their appropriate dashboards based on their roles.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Page Refresh Logout Issue
- **Problem**: Users were getting logged out when refreshing the page
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced `checkAuthStatus` in `authSlice.js` to properly validate tokens with backend
  - Improved token expiration checking before making API calls
  - Added proper error handling for invalid/expired tokens
  - Updated `/auth/me` endpoint to use correct user ID field

### 2. Implemented Role-Based Dashboard Routing
- **Problem**: All users were redirected to PatientDashboard regardless of role
- **Solution**:
  - Updated App.jsx to use the role-based `Dashboard` component instead of hardcoded `PatientDashboard`
  - Enhanced `Dashboard.jsx` with better loading states and error handling
  - Removed duplicate `PatientDashboard.jsx` from components folder
  - Added Dashboard navigation links to NavBar for authenticated users

### 3. Dashboard Components Structure
```
pages/
├── Dashboard.jsx          # Role-based router component
├── PatientDashboard.jsx   # Patient-specific dashboard
├── PharmacyDashboard.jsx  # Pharmacy-specific dashboard
└── AdminDashboard.jsx     # Admin-specific dashboard
```

## User Flow After Login

### Patient Users (role: 'patient')
1. Login → `/dashboard` → `PatientDashboard.jsx`
2. Features: Prescription management, order tracking, pharmacy search, consultations

### Pharmacy Users (role: 'pharmacy')
1. Login → `/dashboard` → `PharmacyDashboard.jsx`
2. Features: Prescription queue, inventory management, patient chat, transactions

### Admin Users (role: 'admin')
1. Login → `/dashboard` → `AdminDashboard.jsx`
2. Features: System management, user oversight, analytics, settings

## Navigation Structure
- **Home** (`/`) - Available to all users
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Only shown to authenticated users, routes based on role
- **Profile** (`/profile`) - Only shown to authenticated users
- **Settings** (`/settings`) - Available to all users

## Authentication State Management
1. **App Load**: `checkAuthStatus()` is dispatched in `main.jsx`
2. **Token Validation**: Frontend validates token expiration before API calls
3. **Backend Verification**: `/auth/me` endpoint validates token and returns user data
4. **Graceful Handling**: Invalid tokens trigger logout and redirect to login

## Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: Login and Refresh
1. Register/Login as a patient
2. Verify you're redirected to PatientDashboard
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify you remain logged in and on the same dashboard

### Test Case 2: Role-Based Routing
1. Login as different user roles
2. Verify each role is redirected to their specific dashboard:
   - Patient → PatientDashboard (with patient-specific sidebar)
   - Pharmacy → PharmacyDashboard (with pharmacy-specific sidebar)
   - Admin → AdminDashboard (with admin-specific sidebar)

### Test Case 3: Navigation
1. Login as any user
2. Verify Dashboard link appears in navigation
3. Click Dashboard link and verify correct dashboard loads
4. Verify other role-specific features work

## File Changes Made
1. `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Updated routing
2. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Enhanced role-based routing
3. `frontend/src/features/auth/authSlice.js` - Fixed checkAuthStatus
4. `frontend/src/components/layout/NavBar.jsx` - Added Dashboard navigation
5. `backend/src/routes/authRoutes.js` - Fixed /auth/me endpoint
6. Removed duplicate: `frontend/src/components/PatientDashboard.jsx`

## Current Status
✅ Authentication persists on page refresh
✅ Role-based dashboard routing implemented  
✅ Duplicate components removed
✅ Navigation updated with Dashboard links
✅ Proper loading states and error handling
