# Design Document

## Overview

The Doctor Profile Management feature provides a comprehensive interface for doctors to manage all aspects of their professional profile. The design leverages the existing doctor model and API structure while extending functionality to support complete profile management through both frontend components and backend services.

The feature is built around a multi-section profile interface that allows doctors to update personal information, medical credentials, professional details, consultation settings, and availability preferences. The design ensures data validation, real-time updates, and seamless integration with the existing platform ecosystem.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a component-based architecture using React with Redux for state management:

```
DoctorProfileManagement/
├── DoctorProfileContainer.jsx (Main container)
├── sections/
│   ├── PersonalInfoSection.jsx
│   ├── MedicalLicenseSection.jsx
│   ├── SpecializationsSection.jsx
│   ├── QualificationsSection.jsx
│   ├── ExperienceSection.jsx
│   ├── ConsultationModesSection.jsx
│   ├── AvailabilitySection.jsx
│   ├── NotificationPreferencesSection.jsx
│   └── ProfileStatsSection.jsx
├── forms/
│   ├── EditableField.jsx
│   ├── MultiSelectField.jsx
│   ├── TimeSlotPicker.jsx
│   └── DocumentUploader.jsx
└── hooks/
    ├── useDoctorProfile.js
    ├── useProfileValidation.js
    └── useProfileSave.js
```

### Backend Architecture

The backend extends the existing doctor controller and routes:

```
Backend Structure:
├── routes/doctorRoutes.js (Extended)
├── controllers/DoctorController.js (Extended)
├── services/
│   ├── DoctorProfileService.js
│   ├── ProfileValidationService.js
│   └── DocumentUploadService.js
├── middleware/
│   ├── profileValidation.js
│   └── fileUpload.js
└── models/Doctor.js (Already exists)
```

## Components and Interfaces

#### Section Components
Each section handles a specific aspect of the doctor profile:

**PersonalInfoSection**

- Handles profile image upload
- Validates contact information format

**MedicalLicenseSection**
- Manages license information and documents
- Handles document upload and verification status
- Validates license expiry dates

**SpecializationsSection**
- Multi-select interface for medical specializations
- Dynamic addition/removal of specializations
- Integration with platform specialization taxonomy

**QualificationsSection**
- Dynamic list of educational qualifications
- Add/edit/remove qualification entries
- Validation of degree and institution information

**ExperienceSection**
- Professional experience and workplace information
- Current position and work history
- Bio editing with rich text support

**ConsultationModesSection**
- Configuration of available consultation types
- Fee and duration settings for each mode
- Real-time preview of patient-facing information

**AvailabilitySection**
- Weekly schedule configuration
- Time slot management
- Break time and advance booking settings

### Backend Services

#### DoctorProfileService
Centralized service for profile operations:

```javascript
class DoctorProfileService {
  async getFullProfile(doctorId)
  async updateProfileSection(doctorId, section, data)
  async validateProfileData(profileData)
  async syncProfileChanges(doctorId, changes)
}
```

#### ProfileValidationService
Handles comprehensive profile validation:

```javascript
class ProfileValidationService {
  validatePersonalInfo(data)
  validateMedicalLicense(licenseData)
  validateSpecializations(specializations)
  validateConsultationModes(modes)
  validateWorkingHours(hours)
}
```

#### DocumentUploadService
Manages document uploads for licenses and certificates:

```javascript
class DocumentUploadService {
  async uploadDocument(file, documentType, doctorId)
  async validateDocument(file)
  async deleteDocument(documentId)
}
```

## Data Models

### Profile Update Request Model
```javascript
{
  section: String, // 'personal', 'license', 'specializations', etc.
  data: Object,    // Section-specific data
  timestamp: Date,
  userId: ObjectId
}
```

### Validation Error Model
```javascript
{
  field: String,
  message: String,
  code: String,
  severity: 'error' | 'warning'
}
```

### Profile Change Log Model
```javascript
{
  doctorId: ObjectId,
  section: String,
  changes: Object,
  previousValues: Object,
  timestamp: Date,
  userId: ObjectId
}
```

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling

**Validation Errors**
- Real-time field validation with immediate feedback
- Section-level validation before save operations
- Clear error messaging with correction guidance

**Network Errors**
- Retry mechanisms for failed save operations
- Offline state detection and queuing
- User-friendly error messages with recovery options

**State Management Errors**
- Redux error boundaries for state corruption
- Automatic state recovery mechanisms
- Fallback to cached profile data

### Backend Error Handling

**Validation Errors**
- Comprehensive input validation with detailed error responses
- Business rule validation (e.g., license expiry, specialization limits)
- Structured error responses for frontend consumption

**Database Errors**
- Transaction rollback for failed profile updates
- Optimistic locking for concurrent edit prevention
- Data integrity checks and recovery

**File Upload Errors**
- File type and size validation
- Virus scanning for uploaded documents
- Secure file storage with access controls

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication for all profile operations
- Role-based access control (doctor can only edit own profile)
- Session validation for sensitive operations

### Data Protection
- Input sanitization for all profile fields
- SQL injection prevention in database queries
- XSS protection in frontend rendering
- CSRF protection for form submissions

### File Upload Security
- File type validation and restrictions
- Virus scanning for uploaded documents
- Secure file storage with access controls
- Document encryption for sensitive files

### Privacy Protection
- Data minimization in API responses
- Audit logging for profile changes
- GDPR compliance for data handling
- Secure deletion of removed documents

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Performance
- Lazy loading of profile sections
- Debounced input validation
- Optimistic UI updates
- Image optimization and caching

### Backend Performance
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Caching of frequently accessed profile data
- Batch operations for multiple field updates
- Asynchronous file processing

### Network Optimization
- Compressed API responses
- Incremental profile updates (only changed fields)
- CDN integration for document storage
- Request deduplication for concurrent operations

## Integration Points

### Platform Integration
