# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an advanced notification system for the healthcare platform. The system will provide comprehensive notification capabilities including real-time notifications, email, and SMS across all user roles (patients, doctors, pharmacies, and admins) integrated into all backend controller functions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Channel Notification System

**User Story:** As a platform user (patient, doctor, pharmacy, admin), I want to receive notifications through multiple channels (in-app, email, SMS), so that I never miss important updates about my healthcare activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is triggered THEN the system SHALL support delivery through websocket, email, and SMS channels
2. WHEN a user sets notification preferences THEN the system SHALL respect channel preferences for each notification type
3. WHEN a notification fails on one channel THEN the system SHALL attempt delivery through alternative channels based on priority
4. WHEN a notification is sent THEN the system SHALL log delivery status for each channel
5. IF a notification is critical THEN the system SHALL override user preferences and send through all available channels

### Requirement 2: Role-Based Notification Distribution

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want notifications to be automatically sent to appropriate user roles based on the triggering event, so that relevant stakeholders are informed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient action occurs THEN the system SHALL notify relevant doctors and pharmacies automatically
2. WHEN a doctor action occurs THEN the system SHALL notify relevant patients and admins automatically
3. WHEN a pharmacy action occurs THEN the system SHALL notify relevant patients and doctors automatically
4. WHEN a system event occurs THEN the system SHALL notify all admins automatically
5. WHEN a critical event occurs THEN the system SHALL notify all relevant parties regardless of their notification preferences

### Requirement 3: Controller Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want notification functionality integrated into all backend controllers, so that every significant action triggers appropriate notifications without additional implementation effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any CRUD operation occurs in any controller THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger relevant notifications
2. WHEN a prescription is created/updated THEN the system SHALL notify patient, doctor, and relevant pharmacies
3. WHEN an order status changes THEN the system SHALL notify patient and pharmacy
4. WHEN an appointment is scheduled/modified THEN the system SHALL notify patient and doctor
5. WHEN inventory levels change THEN the system SHALL notify pharmacy staff and admins if thresholds are met
6. WHEN user registration occurs THEN the system SHALL send welcome notifications and admin alerts
7. WHEN payment transactions occur THEN the system SHALL notify all relevant parties

### Requirement 4: Email Notification System

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to receive detailed email notifications for important events, so that I have a permanent record and can access full information even when offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an email notification is triggered THEN the system SHALL use professional HTML templates
2. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL include relevant attachments (prescriptions, receipts, etc.)
3. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
4. WHEN emails are sent THEN the system SHALL track open rates and click-through rates
5. IF email preferences are disabled THEN the system SHALL still send critical notifications via email

### Requirement 5: SMS Notification System

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to receive urgent notifications via SMS, so that I can respond quickly to time-sensitive healthcare matters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an SMS notification is triggered THEN the system SHALL send concise, actionable messages
2. WHEN sending SMS THEN the system SHALL respect character limits and include essential information only
3. WHEN SMS delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt alternative notification methods
4. WHEN SMS is sent THEN the system SHALL track delivery status and user responses
5. IF SMS preferences are disabled THEN the system SHALL still send emergency notifications via SMS

### Requirement 6: Notification Templates and Personalization

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to receive personalized notifications that are relevant to my role and context, so that I can quickly understand what action is required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is created THEN the system SHALL use role-specific templates
2. WHEN generating notification content THEN the system SHALL personalize with user-specific data
3. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL include relevant context and action buttons
4. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL version control changes and maintain backward compatibility
5. IF multiple languages are supported THEN the system SHALL send notifications in the user's preferred language

### Requirement 7: Notification Preferences and Management

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to control my notification preferences for different types of events and channels, so that I receive only the notifications I want through my preferred methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses notification settings THEN the system SHALL display all available notification types and channels
2. WHEN a user updates preferences THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes to future notifications
3. WHEN preferences are saved THEN the system SHALL validate settings and provide feedback
4. WHEN critical notifications occur THEN the system SHALL override user preferences for safety-critical events
5. IF a user disables all notifications THEN the system SHALL still send legally required notifications

### Requirement 8: Real-time Notification Delivery

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to receive instant notifications for urgent events, so that I can respond immediately to critical healthcare situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is online THEN the system SHALL deliver notifications via websocket immediately
2. WHEN a notification is urgent THEN the system SHALL bypass queuing and send immediately
3. WHEN multiple users need the same notification THEN the system SHALL broadcast efficiently
4. WHEN a user comes online THEN the system SHALL deliver queued notifications in chronological order
5. IF websocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative delivery methods

### Requirement 9: Notification Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor notification system performance and user engagement, so that I can optimize the system and ensure critical notifications are being delivered effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL track delivery rates by channel and user role
2. WHEN users interact with notifications THEN the system SHALL record engagement metrics
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide insights on notification effectiveness
4. WHEN system issues occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators immediately
5. IF delivery rates drop below thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically escalate to administrators

### Requirement 10: Integration with External Services

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the notification system to integrate with reliable third-party services for email and SMS delivery, so that notifications are delivered with high reliability and scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating email services THEN the system SHALL support multiple providers (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
2. WHEN integrating SMS services THEN the system SHALL support multiple providers (Twilio, AWS SNS, etc.)
3. WHEN a service fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup providers
4. WHEN service costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
5. IF external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue notifications for retry when services recover
