## Quick Start

### 1. Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to production with current git commit
./scripts/deploy.sh production

# Deploy specific version
./scripts/deploy.sh production v1.2.3

# Deploy with custom options
SKIP_TESTS=true ./scripts/deploy.sh production
```

### 2. Staging Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy.sh staging

# Deploy and monitor
./scripts/deploy.sh staging && ./scripts/gradual-rollout.sh monitor enableSMSNotifications
```

### 3. Feature Flag Rollout

```bash
# Gradual rollout of a feature
./scripts/gradual-rollout.sh gradualRollout enableEmailTracking 100

# Canary deployment
./scripts/gradual-rollout.sh canaryDeployment enableRealTimeNotifications 50

# Emergency stop
./scripts/gradual-rollout.sh emergencyStop enableSMSNotifications
```

### 4. Rollback

```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
./scripts/rollback.sh /backups/notification-system/pre_deployment_20240115_143022.tar.gz
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

The default deployment strategy uses blue-green deployment for zero-downtime deployments:

1. **Current State**: Application running on "blue" environment
2. **Deploy**: New version deployed to "green" environment
3. **Test**: Health checks and smoke tests on green environment
4. **Switch**: Load balancer switches traffic to green environment
5. **Cleanup**: Blue environment is stopped

**Benefits**:
- Zero downtime
- Instant rollback capability
- Full environment testing before switch

### Gradual Rollout

For feature flags, gradual rollout allows controlled feature releases:

1. **5%**: Deploy to 5% of users for 1 hour
2. **25%**: Increase to 25% of users for 4 hours
3. **50%**: Increase to 50% of users for 8 hours
4. **100%**: Full rollout after 24 hours

**Benefits**:
- Risk mitigation
- Real-world testing with limited impact
- Automatic rollback on health check failures

### Canary Deployment

Canary deployment tests new features with a small subset of users:

1. **Canary**: Deploy to 10% of users for 2 hours
2. **Monitor**: Check success criteria (error rate, response time, user satisfaction)
3. **Decide**: Proceed with full rollout or rollback based on metrics
4. **Full Rollout**: Deploy to 100% of users if canary succeeds

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

Environment-specific configuration is managed through `.env` files:

- `config/production.env`: Production configuration
- `config/staging.env`: Staging configuration

**Key Configuration Areas**:
- Database connections (MongoDB, Redis)
- External service credentials (SendGrid, Twilio, AWS)
- Security settings (JWT secrets, encryption keys)
- Performance tuning (connection pools, timeouts)
- Feature flags and toggles

### Feature Flags

Feature flags are managed through `feature-flags/feature-flags.json`:

```json
{
  "featureFlags": {
    "notifications": {
      "enableSMSNotifications": {
        "enabled": true,
        "rolloutPercentage": 100,
        "environments": {
          "production": true,
          "staging": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Feature Flag Categories**:
- **Notifications**: Core notification features
- **Channels**: Delivery channel toggles
- **Providers**: External service provider toggles
- **Security**: Security feature toggles
- **Performance**: Performance optimization toggles
- **Experimental**: Beta and experimental features

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Prometheus Metrics

The deployment includes comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus:

- **Application Metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Database Metrics**: MongoDB and Redis performance
- **External Service Metrics**: SendGrid and Twilio API health
- **Business Metrics**: Notification delivery rates, user engagement

### Alerting Rules

Automated alerts are configured for:

- **Critical**: Service down, database failures, security breaches
- **Warning**: High error rates, performance degradation, resource usage
- **Info**: Deployment notifications, feature rollout updates

### Grafana Dashboards

Pre-configured dashboards provide visibility into:

- System health and performance
- Notification delivery metrics
- User engagement analytics
- External service status
- Feature flag rollout progress

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Encrypted storage for API keys and passwords
- Rotation procedures for credentials
- Access control for configuration files

### Network Security

- Firewall rules for service isolation
- SSL/TLS encryption for all communications
- VPN access for administrative functions
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

### Compliance

- HIPAA compliance features for healthcare data
- Audit logging for all system activities
- Data retention and cleanup policies
- Privacy controls for user data

## Backup and Recovery

### Automated Backups

- **Database**: Daily MongoDB and Redis backups
- **Configuration**: Application and system configuration backups
- **Code**: Git-based version control with tagged releases
- **Logs**: Centralized log collection and archival

### Recovery Procedures

- **Application Recovery**: Rollback scripts for quick restoration
- **Database Recovery**: Point-in-time recovery from backups
- **Configuration Recovery**: Environment restoration from backups
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region backup replication

## Performance Optimization

### Scaling Strategies

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple application instances with load balancing
- **Vertical Scaling**: Resource allocation based on usage patterns
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on metrics and thresholds
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and sharding strategies

### Caching

- **Application Cache**: Redis for session and preference caching
- **Template Cache**: Compiled template caching for performance
- **CDN**: Content delivery network for static assets
- **Database Cache**: Query result caching and optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check pre-deployment health checks
   - Verify environment configuration
   - Review application logs for errors
   - Validate external service connectivity

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor resource usage metrics
   - Check database query performance
   - Analyze external service response times
   - Review caching effectiveness

3. **Feature Flag Issues**
   - Verify feature flag configuration
   - Check rollout percentage and user segments
   - Monitor feature-specific metrics
   - Review dependency requirements

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# View application logs
pm2 logs notification-service

# Check database connectivity
mongosh $MONGODB_URI --eval "db.runCommand('ping')"

# Test external services
curl -X GET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/user/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENDGRID_API_KEY"

# Monitor system resources
top -p $(pgrep -f notification-service)
```

## Best Practices

### Deployment

1. **Always test in staging first**
2. **Use gradual rollouts for new features**
3. **Monitor metrics during and after deployment**
4. **Have rollback procedures ready**
5. **Document all changes and decisions**

### Configuration

1. **Use environment-specific configurations**
2. **Keep secrets secure and rotated**
3. **Version control all configuration changes**
4. **Validate configuration before deployment**
5. **Use feature flags for risky changes**

### Monitoring

1. **Set up comprehensive alerting**
2. **Monitor business metrics, not just technical ones**
3. **Use dashboards for real-time visibility**
4. **Regularly review and update alert thresholds**
5. **Practice incident response procedures**
