## 🚀 Implementation Highlights

### 1. **Consistent Error Handling**
All notification calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks to prevent main workflow interruption:
```javascript
try {
  await UserNotificationService.sendAppointmentBooked(consultation, patientUser, doctorUser);
} catch (notificationError) {
  console.error('⚠️ Failed to send notification:', notificationError.message);
}
```

### 2. **Smart User Data Fetching**
Notifications automatically fetch required user information:
```javascript
const patientUser = await User.findById(req.user._id);
const doctorUser = await User.findById(doctorId);
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Coverage**
Every major user action now triggers appropriate notifications:
- **Registration** → Welcome notification
- **Verification** → Completion confirmation  
- **Profile Updates** → Change notifications
- **Appointments** → Booking and reminder notifications
- **Consultations** → Start and completion notifications
- **Orders** → Placement and status notifications
- **Payments** → Success and failure notifications
- **Prescriptions** → Upload and response notifications

2. **Doctor gets**: "New Appointment Booked - John Doe has booked an appointment with you for Aug 17 at 15:30"
3. **Both get**: Action buttons to view appointment details
4. **System tracks**: Delivery status, read receipts, user engagement
