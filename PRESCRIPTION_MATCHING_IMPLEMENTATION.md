# Prescription Matching Service Implementation

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the prescription matching system as requested. Here's what the system does:

### 1. **After Prescription Upload & Processing**
When a patient uploads a prescription via the `PrescriptionUpload.jsx` component:

1. **File Processing**: The prescription image/PDF is processed using OCR and AI to extract medication information
2. **Database Storage**: The processed prescription data is saved to the database
3. **Pharmacy Matching**: The system automatically finds matching pharmacies

### 2. **Pharmacy Matching Logic**
The `PrescriptionRequestMatchingService` implements the core matching logic:

#### Distance Check (≤ 50km)
- Uses MongoDB's geospatial queries with the pharmacy's `location` field (GeoJSON Point)
- Calculates distance using the Haversine formula
- Only includes pharmacies within 50km radius

#### Inventory Check
- For each pharmacy within 50km, queries the `InventoryItem` collection
- Checks if ALL required medications are available (`quantityAvailable > 0`)
- Uses normalized medicine name matching to handle variations
- Only includes pharmacies that have ALL prescription medications in stock

### 3. **Prescription Request Creation**
For pharmacies that meet both criteria:
- Creates a `PrescriptionRequest` document
- Links the patient, prescription, and matching pharmacies
- Sets up the request with proper urgency levels and metadata

### 4. **Pharmacy Notification**
When the patient submits the request:
- Sends notifications to all matching pharmacy owners
- Creates entries in the `Notification` collection
- Pharmacies receive the request in their queue

### 5. **Pharmacy Response**
Pharmacies can:
- **Approve**: Accept the prescription request and provide fulfillment details
- **Reject**: Decline with a reason
- **Respond** via the existing `PrescriptionRequestController.respondToRequest` endpoint

## Key Files Modified/Fixed:

### Backend:
1. **`PrescriptionRequestMatchingService.js`** - Core matching logic with proper distance calculation and inventory checking
2. **`PrescriptionController.js`** - Already had the `processPrescriptionAndCreateRequest` method
3. **Routes** - Already properly configured

### Frontend:
1. **`PrescriptionUpload.jsx`** - Fixed a small bug with undefined `setIsProcessing`
2. **API calls** - Already properly configured to call the backend endpoints

## How It Works:

1. **Patient uploads prescription** → Frontend calls `/api/prescriptions/process-and-request`
2. **Backend processes** → Extracts medications, saves to DB
3. **Automatic matching** → Finds pharmacies within 50km with all medications
4. **Returns results** → Frontend shows matching pharmacies
5. **Patient submits** → Sends request to all matching pharmacies
6. **Notifications sent** → Pharmacies receive notifications
7. **Pharmacies respond** → Can approve/reject via their dashboard

## Technical Features:

- **Geospatial Queries**: Using MongoDB 2dsphere index for efficient location-based searches
- **Fuzzy Medicine Matching**: Normalized name comparison for medication matching
- **Inventory Integration**: Real-time stock checking using the InventoryItem model
- **Notification System**: Proper notification creation for pharmacy owners
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the flow
- **Distance Calculation**: Haversine formula for accurate distance computation

The system is now ready to automatically match patients with pharmacies based on location and inventory availability!
