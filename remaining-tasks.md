## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Critical for MVP)
1. **Authentication Frontend Components** - Users can't properly register/login
2. **Prescription Upload Interface** - Core functionality for patients
3. **Pharmacy Discovery System** - Essential for prescription matching
4. **Order Tracking Frontend** - Users need to track their orders

### Medium Priority (Important for Full Functionality)
1. **Pharmacy Registration System** - Needed for pharmacy onboarding
2. **Prescription Processing Workflow** - Required for pharmacy operations
3. **Payment System Enhancements** - Needed for transactions
4. **Admin Panel Enhancements** - Required for system management

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Important but system works on desktop
2. **Advanced Security Features** - Basic security is implemented
3. **Performance Optimizations** - Can be done after core features
4. **Testing and QA** - Should be ongoing but not blocking

## Next Steps

1. Start with High Priority items to get a working MVP
2. Focus on one feature area at a time to avoid conflicts
3. Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
4. Consider user feedback and iterate on implemented features
5. Plan for gradual rollout of Medium and Low Priority features

This analysis shows that while significant progress has been made, there are still important gaps that need to be filled to have a fully functional system.
